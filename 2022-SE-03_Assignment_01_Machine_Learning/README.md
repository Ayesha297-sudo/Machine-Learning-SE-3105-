# HCT Survival Analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes a **Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) survival dataset**, identifying key factors affecting patient outcomes. The study involves **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling** using machine learning.

## Key Insights  

### Data Preprocessing  
- **Missing values** handled through imputation.  
- **Outliers** detected and treated to ensure accurate analysis.  
- **Standardization & Normalization** applied to continuous features for consistency.  

### Exploratory Analysis  
- **Age & Survival:** Younger patients showed higher survival probabilities.  
- **Comorbidities:** Pre-existing conditions like **diabetes** significantly reduced survival rates.  
- **Primary Disease Impact:** Survival rates varied based on disease type.  
- **Racial Disparities:** Differences in survival outcomes observed, requiring further investigation.  
- **Gender Analysis:** Marginal differences in survival rates between males and females.  

### Metrics Used  
- **Stratified Concordance Index** to evaluate survival balance across different patient groups.  

## Conclusion  
- **Age, primary disease, comorbidities, and racial factors** significantly impact HCT survival.  
- **Proper preprocessing** (handling missing values, feature engineering) was crucial for reliable analysis.  

## Future Work  
Future enhancements include implementing **machine learning models** for better survival predictions:  
- **Logistic Regression** for binary survival classification.  
- **Decision Trees & Random Forest** for feature importance analysis.  
- **Neural Networks** for improved predictive accuracy.  
- **Evaluation using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and accuracy metrics.**
